# city-explorer-api


**Author**: Sarah Mahdi
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

- In this lab we created a server to host data
- When the user click explorer, he will be shown a map, the weather forecast related to the city the user searches.

## Getting Started

- After you create you repo on GITHUB you need to run npm init
- Next you need to npm install express, dotenvm and cors to help create the server
- Make sure you set your PORT to 3001 in your .env

## Architecture

- We used node.js, JS, REACT, Bootstrap. We used try-catch statements with the key word 'get' and async to retrieve data from the our back-end server
